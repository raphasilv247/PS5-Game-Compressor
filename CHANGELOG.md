# Changelog

## 1.0.4 - 2026-08-21

Compared `release1.0.4` against `v1.0.3`.

Full release notes: [RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.4.md](RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.4.md).

### Added

- Added German, French, Arabic, Italian, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese UI
  translations with automatic system-language selection and a persistent
  manual language selector.
- Added right-to-left layout support for Arabic, including bidirectional text
  isolation and responsive layout adjustments.
- Added localized Game Compressor launcher titles for every supported language.
- Added ShadowMountPlus executable discovery under `/data/ps5_autoloader` in
  addition to the existing Payload Manager locations.

### Changed

- Improved firmware 4.51 browser compatibility with physical-edge CSS
  fallbacks for older WebKit behavior.
- Improved relaunch handling when a previous Game Compressor instance leaves
  port 5910 open but no longer answers the local HTTP handoff.
- Added more detailed web-server socket, bind, listen, and client-thread
  diagnostics.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Build AMPR Index` for directly detected game folders so enqueue and
  worker resolution use the same APR-EMU probe result, including its source
  path and SHA-256.
- Fixed APR-EMU module permissions for affected deployment and loading paths.
- Fixed the compression wizard so `Delete after verified` keeps its own
  free-space and deletion explanation when switching source-preservation
  options.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-06-20

Compared PR #22 (`release1.0.3`) against `v1.0.2`.

Full release notes: [RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.3.md](RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.3.md).

### Fixed

- Fixed USB-to-USB compression reliability by zeroing the PFSC header area,
  outer PFS metadata, and final outer PFS padding instead of relying on sparse
  allocation or later backpatches.
- Fixed compressed APR-EMU update and AMPR index rebuild paths so rewritten
  compressed images also zero their final outer PFS padding.
- Fixed validate and repair so older Game Compressor `.ffpfsc` images can have
  outer wrapper padding cleaned before mount, while third-party or non-wrapper
  layouts skip that cleanup and continue normal validation.
- Fixed post-operation reminders so the terminate reminder waits behind failure
  notices and only appears after successful operations.

### Changed

- Clarified the compression format picker: compression always outputs a
  compressed `.ffpfsc` archive, and the selected format controls the nested
  image inside that archive.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-06-20

Compared PR #20 (`new_release_items`) against `origin/main` / `v1.0.1`.

Full release notes: [RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.2.md](RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.2.md).

### Added

- Added APR-EMU version management for titles that include `libSceAmpr.sprx`.
  Game Compressor can discover the current APR-EMU binary, cache known versions,
  download the latest manifest version, upload a custom `.sprx`/`.prx`, apply a
  selected version, and restore the original title-provided binary when a backup
  is available.
- Added APR-EMU hot-swap support for direct `.exfat` images and compressed
  `.ffpfsc` images. Updates can patch compatible images in place, grow image
  tail space when needed, rebuild compressed images when required, and verify the
  mounted APR-EMU hash after the update.
- Added exFAT image APR indexing support that can insert or refresh
  `ampr_emu.index` directly inside `.exfat` and compressed exFAT-backed
  `.ffpfsc` images.
- Added AMPR hot-swap layout metadata during image creation and compression so
  APR-EMU binaries, indexes, exFAT metadata, and related payload files are
  placed in update-friendly raw/tail regions.
- Added browser-friendly title icon thumbnails served through `/api/gc/icon`,
  with cached resized PNGs for the library and full-size icons for selected
  titles.
- Added persistent UI color-mode settings with light/dark mode controls, a
  backend settings file, and a browser cookie so the selected theme is applied
  before the page finishes loading.
- Added app version display in the sidebar and About dialog using the runtime
  `/api/status` version.

### Changed

- Compression now defaults to raw storage for executable payload blocks and
  broadens executable detection to include `iboot*.bin`, `.self`, `.elf`,
  `.dll`, and `.so` files in addition to existing executable formats.
- Compression layout planning now keeps AMPR-related files and exFAT structures
  in raw regions when hot-swap optimization is enabled, improving future
  APR-EMU update compatibility.
- AMPR index generation can now build the index in memory as well as on disk,
  allowing image patchers to inject the generated index without staging a folder
  file first.
- Validation progress reporting now includes richer copied-byte/block progress
  and ETA data for long validation and mounted-scan phases.
- The web UI now treats APR-EMU update as a first-class primary action when a
  newer cached/latest version is available, while keeping normal title actions
  accessible from the secondary menu.
- The About dialog and terminate controls were cleaned up, and the launcher
  install path was simplified to always refresh the home tile assets without
  extra file-diff probing or install notifications.

### Fixed

- Fixed APR-EMU update flows so Game Compressor records selected versions by
  title/source, saves verified original binaries before replacement, and avoids
  repeatedly flagging intentionally selected cached or custom versions as stale.
- Fixed compressed-image AMPR patching by verifying nested PFS file allocation,
  rejecting oversized replacements with clear recompress guidance, and using a
  rebuild path when in-place patching is not possible.
- Fixed direct exFAT AMPR patching by rejecting fragmented target allocations,
  updating directory entries/FAT/bitmap state consistently, and verifying the
  final binary or index contents after patching.
- Fixed UI feedback for APR-EMU operations, including update-needed chips,
  installed/latest/custom version labels, operation history labels, failure
  messages, and progress states.
- Fixed dark-mode coverage for chips, modals, menus, buttons, notices, progress
  panels, and selected rows.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-06-18

Compared `new_release_items` against `v1.0.0`.

Full release notes: [RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.1.md](RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.1.md).

### Added

- Added `Make Image` for APR Emu workflows. Game Compressor can create direct
  `.exfat` or `.ffpfs` images from folder games so APR Emu titles can run from
  internal SSD.
- For image creation, Game Compressor automatically builds or refreshes
  `ampr_emu.index` when needed and automatically applies the ShadowMountPlus
  read-only image setting for the created image.
- Added `Set Read Only` for existing image entries. Game Compressor writes the
  ShadowMountPlus read-only image hint and requests a rescan for the selected
  image.

### Changed

- `.exfat` is the recommended and faster image type for APR Emu internal-SSD
  image workflows.
- Improved ShadowMountPlus source discovery by respecting configured `scanpath`,
  `scan_depth`, `recursive_scan`, and manual-list entries.
- Improved uncompress and decompression destination handling for image and
  folder outputs.
- Simplified compression choices by removing the old Fast/miniz profile path and
  the temporary raw-only user flow.
- Consolidated move and copy actions into target pickers for internal and
  external storage.

### Fixed

- Improved output-exists errors and UI failure notices.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-17

Compared local `AMPRSupport` against `v0.9.9`.

Full release notes: [RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.0.md](RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.0.md).

### Added

- Added built-in APR Emu indexing for compressed titles. Game Compressor now
  performs the same `build_ampr_index.py` index-building work directly on the
  PS5 before compressing any title that uses APR Emu.
- Added native `ampr_emu.index` generation to safe, stream, PFS, and exFAT
  folder compression paths, including pre-compress scan integration.
- Added a folder-only secondary `Build AMPR Index` action so users can build or
  refresh an APR index without starting compression.
- Added `APR indexed` presentation on the selected-game screen and operation
  history for indexes generated by Game Compressor.
- Added a full-screen terminated state after using the terminate button, with a
  large red power icon and guidance to exit the browser window.

### Fixed

- Fixed APR Emu titles that could run from writable external compressed storage
  but fail from read-only internal compressed images because the APR index was
  missing, stale, or not generated by the app before compression.
- Replaced any existing `ampr_emu.index` during pre-compress scan for APR Emu
  titles so the compressed image includes a clean app-generated index.
- Removed temporary `ampr_emu.index.tmp` scan entries after successful index
  generation.
- Fixed cleanup of compressed-output validation sidecars such as `.vhash` when
  an output is deleted or removed after a failed operation.
- Fixed UI responsiveness during same-device compression by avoiding overly
  aggressive default worker counts and reducing full-library polling while jobs
  are active.

### Changed

- Pre-compress folder scans now delete common macOS metadata files such as
  `.DS_Store`, `._*`, `.Spotlight-V100`, and `__MACOSX` before building the
  image layout.
- Non-APR titles are unchanged: Game Compressor skips APR index generation
  unless the title has APR Emu markers, already has an `ampr_emu.index`, or the
  user explicitly runs `Build AMPR Index`.
- The `APR indexed` indicator is no longer shown in the sidebar. It is scoped to
  the main game screen and history, and is based on the latest app-recorded
  state for that exact folder.
- Removed the compression optimization selector and the old Fast compression
  profile path.
- Added a Raw only compression mode for APR Emu compatibility. It does not
  reduce storage use, but can help APR Emu titles run from internal SSD.
- The terminate button removes the Game Compressor home-screen tile before
  stopping the payload.

## 0.9.9 - 2026-06-17

Compared local `TestingBetterReads` against `main` / `v0.9.7`
(`29860ca`).

Full release notes: [RELEASE_NOTES_0.9.9.md](RELEASE_NOTES_0.9.9.md).

### Added

- Added an `Extract to Folder` action for mounted image entries. The operation
  copies the live mounted image contents into a normal title folder beside the
  source image, verifies the extracted folder, and then asks ShadowMountPlus to
  switch to the extracted output.
- Added `extract-image` progress, history, job-speed, pending-state, and
  notification labels.
- Added a topbar terminate button and a post-operation reminder so users can
  stop Game Compressor before playing games.
- Added a safe retry path for compression failures caused by unavailable
  free-space probing. History can now offer `Continue anyway` for non-
  destructive compression when the original will be kept until the new output is
  complete and verified.

### Fixed

- Fixed the `/api/gc/extract-image` POST route so the UI action reaches the
  backend handler.
- Fixed free-space checks for output paths whose final folders do not exist yet
  by falling back to the nearest mounted storage root.
- Fixed resume handling for repair journals with invalid or inconsistent
  counters by discarding the bad journal and creating a clean one.
- Fixed title display for `param.json` files that store names under localized
  `localizedParameters` entries.
- Avoided automatic exact size rechecks for USB-hosted folder entries during
  normal library refresh.

### Changed

- Move/copy target roots now prefer existing game parent folders on the selected
  storage, such as `/homebrew` or `/etaHEN/games`, before falling back to the
  default target root.
- New repair journals now explicitly zero their state area before use.
- The payload names its main thread as `game-compressor.elf` for easier
  identification in runtime tools and logs.
- Modal handling now uses shared show/hide helpers with scroll locking and a
  higher modal layer.

## 0.9.7 - 2026-06-15

Compared local `UIPolish` (`f87cdaf`) against `main` / `v0.9.6`
(`cb1a344`).

Full release notes: [RELEASE_NOTES_0.9.7.md](RELEASE_NOTES_0.9.7.md).

### Fixed

- Fixed crashes and UI stalls caused by exact size scanning of large USB-hosted
  folders during normal library refreshes.
- Fixed operations against duplicate title IDs by requiring and propagating the
  selected `sourcePath` through API requests and operation fallback rows.
- Fixed ShadowMount remount/refresh handling for duplicate instances by clearing
  stale links, requesting title-specific source scans, and restoring previous
  links when refresh fails or is cancelled.
- Fixed USB compression and uncompression throughput cases by allowing
  simultaneous read/write work only when source and destination are confirmed to
  be on different physical devices.
- Fixed validation progress percentages, ETA, and speed reporting for validation
  and mounted scan phases.
- Fixed compression speed reporting and improved compression worker throughput
  by reusing zlib compressor state per worker.
- Fixed destructive and delete workflows so cancel buttons are disabled once
  cancellation would leave data in an unsafe state.
- Fixed cache and artifact state after compression, uncompression, move/copy,
  delete, validation, repair, and failed cleanup paths.
- Fixed history and active-job rendering after browser refreshes by reconciling
  selected game instances against source paths and current output paths.
- Fixed compressed-source cleanup for uncompress operations by quarantining the
  source first and restoring it on failure where possible.
- Fixed ShadowMount manual list growth by replacing existing entries for the
  same title/source instead of appending duplicate scan lines.

### Operational Improvements

- Added a source-path-aware operation model so duplicate title IDs on internal,
  external, USB, compressed, mounted, and current-output locations can be acted
  on independently.
- Added a persistent background size-estimate cache for folder-based games,
  including queued, scanning, refreshing, cached, done, and failed states.
- Added a size-priority API used by the selected game view so the selected
  folder can be measured before lower-priority library entries.
- Added storage-overlap policy detection for compression and decompression so
  reads and writes can be pipelined when source and destination are on different
  physical devices.
- Added parallel folder scanning and windowed PFSC decompression paths with
  serial fallbacks when worker startup, memory, or same-device I/O policy does
  not allow pipelining.
- Compression workers now reuse zlib stream state instead of reinitializing it
  for each block, improving compression throughput.
- Compression and decompression now use cancel-aware reads, writes, condition
  waits, and worker accounting so long operations respond more predictably before
  entering unsafe phases.
- Added cancel-disable reporting for phases that cannot safely be interrupted,
  including destructive stream compression after mutation begins and active data
  deletion.
- Added a Delete Game Data action with confirmation, source hiding, ShadowMount
  rescan, cache invalidation, and startup cleanup for interrupted delete temp
  paths.
- Added ShadowMountPlus config/manual-list management for source-specific scans,
  title-aware manual list replacement, and Payload Manager fallback launch when
  a running ShadowMountPlus process cannot be restarted directly.
- Added scan and measurement progress metadata to jobs and history rows for
  large folder scans and compression preflight work.
- USB and external-storage workflows now preserve exact target roots in
  operation history instead of only recording a generic device name.
- Operation history now includes direction, output path, target root, saved
  space, scan summaries, repair summaries, read-test metrics, preserved-original
  paths, and compression profile details.
- Compression stats markers can infer source size from known source roots when
  exact operation metadata is not available, improving saved-space reporting for
  existing compressed output.
- Shared helpers now centralize JSON escaping, path/filesystem utilities, job
  timing helpers, and PFS I/O policy logic.
- The launcher startup path was simplified to use the current launcher API.
- Dead and duplicated code was removed from API, web server, app installer,
  diagnostic, miniz, compression, decompression, repair, and transfer helpers.

### UI Enhancements

- The web UI now shows explicit loading states while the game library is being
  scanned instead of rendering an empty list/detail panel.
- Added current-output and multiple-location presentation in the web UI so users
  can distinguish the active result from other copies of the same title.
- Game rows and detail headers now use smaller storage/source/location chips,
  clearer USB target labels, and safer text wrapping for long paths and names.
- Progress cards now distinguish resolving, measuring, scanning, publishing,
  deleting, validating, mounting, compressing, uncompressing, reading, moving,
  and finalizing phases.
- Compression and uncompression dialogs now keep original-source controls
  visible, choose safer defaults when writing to another storage device, and mark
  storage-mode choices as not needed when the original is being kept.

## 0.9.6 - 2026-06-12

Compared against `main` because this repository does not currently have a
local or remote `develop` branch.

### Added

- Reworked the web UI with a polished responsive layout, richer game state
  badges, improved progress details, smoother action menus, and clearer
  compression/uncompression dialogs.
- Added compression destination choices for keeping output on the current
  storage, writing to internal SSD, or writing directly to detected external
  storage targets.
- Added external storage discovery for `/mnt/ext0`, `/mnt/ext1`, and
  `/mnt/usb0` through `/mnt/usb7`, including free-space checks and target
  labels in the UI.
- Added move and copy operations between internal storage and external storage,
  including API routes for move/copy to USB and move/copy back to internal SSD.
- Added compression profiles: `space` for smaller output and `fast` for faster
  compression.
- Added destructive stream compression with resumable journal support and a
  minimum-free-space guard for low-space workflows.
- Added validate-only, read-speed-test, read-EOF-test, delete-game-data,
  original-restore, and uncompress-plan API flows.
- Added persistent size caching and background folder-size measurement so large
  title listings do not block the UI.
- Added ShadowMountPlus hint/config management for compressed PFS/exFAT images,
  source scan requests, forced remounts, and restart of a running ShadowMountPlus
  payload when required.
- Added runtime handoff/status state used to resume or report work after a
  browser refresh or payload restart.

### Changed

- Compression now supports optimized worker scheduling, raw-block handling, and
  zlib/miniz/runtime encoder configuration through the Makefile.
- Progress reporting now includes elapsed time, estimated remaining time, speed,
  block counts, repair counters, stream-budget counters, and richer phase names.
- History entries now preserve operation details such as format, profile,
  destination, target root, preserved originals, repair summaries, and read-test
  metrics.
- Repair and validation paths now use `/data/GameCompressor/logs/repair`, with
  runtime data under `/data/GameCompressor`.
- Payload linking now includes notification and IPMI libraries for completion
  notifications and power/idle guard behavior.
- README runtime paths were corrected to match the actual deployed
  `/data/GameCompressor` layout.

### Fixed

- Fixed source deletion ordering so ShadowMountPlus does not see duplicate
  image/source entries during final commit.
- Fixed USB/external-storage compression and transfer handling.
- Fixed parallel writer ordering for USB output cases.
- Improved recovery behavior for interrupted compression, validation, repair,
  remount, and move/copy operations.

## 0.9.5 - 2026-06-07

- Initial public release metadata for the standalone PS5 Game Compressor
  payload.
